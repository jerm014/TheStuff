# Project 2208: C - Static variables, getline
----


## Resources

**Read or watch**:

* [C - Static Variables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/)
* [Google](http://www.google.com)
## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to[explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/),**without the help of Google**:

### General

* What are static variables?
* How and when to use them?
## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors:`vi`,`vim`,`emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with`gcc 9.4.0`using the flags`-Wall``-Werror``-Wextra``and -pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A`README.md`file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the`Betty`style. It will be checked using[betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl)and[betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are allowed to have up to`6 functions`in`_getline.c`
### Allowed Functions and System Calls

* `read`
* `write`
* `malloc`
* `realloc`
* `free`
* `strcpy`
* `strncpy`
* `strcat`
* `strdup`
* `memset`
* `memcpy`
**Great!**You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going!#### Question #0

`static int i;`What is the default value of`i`?

 * We do not know

 * 0

 * This will not compile with gcc 4

 * 98

#### Question #1

`static int i = 10;`What is the default value of`i`?

 * 0

 * 10

 * 98

 * We don�t know

#### Question #2

Static variables are located in/on:

 * The data segment

 * The stack

 * The heap

 * None of the above

#### Question #3

The following program:

`
```
int init()
{
  int i;

  return (i);
}

int main()
{
  static int i = init();

  return (i);
}
```

 * Exits with the value 0

 * Exits with the value 98

 * Exits with an unknown value

 * Does not compile

### 0. Racing cars

Write a function that keeps track of the number of laps made by several cars in a race.<!--plain-NL-->

- Prototype : `void race_state(int *id, size_t size)`
- `id` is an array of `int` representing the �identifier� of each car.
- `size` is the size of this array
- Each car identifier is unique
- If an identifier is unknown:


Create a new car with the number of laps = 0
Print `Car X joined the race` followed by a new line (where `X` is the identifier)
- Create a new car with the number of laps = 0
- Print `Car X joined the race` followed by a new line (where `X` is the identifier)
- Each time the function is called:


The number of laps of each cars listed in `id` must be incremented by 1
Print the state of the race:


Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)
- The number of laps of each cars listed in `id` must be incremented by 1
- Print the state of the race:


Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)
- Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
- For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)
- If your function is called with `size = 0`,you must free all allocated memory.

- Create a new car with the number of laps = 0
- Print `Car X joined the race` followed by a new line (where `X` is the identifier)

- The number of laps of each cars listed in `id` must be incremented by 1
- Print the state of the race:


Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)
- Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
- For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)

- Header: `Race state:` followed by a new line
- For each car sorted by the identifier: `Car X [Y laps]` (where `X` is the identifier and `Y` the number of laps already done)

### 1. _getline

Write a function that reads an entire line from a file descriptor.<!--plain-NL-->

- Prototype : `char *_getline(const int fd)`
- Where `fd` is the file descriptor to read from
- If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error, the function should return `NULL`
- The function returns a null-terminated string that does not include the newline character
- Your header file `_getline.h` should define a macro called `READ_SIZE`.


This macro defines the number of bytes you will read each time you will call `read`: `read(fd, buffer, READ_SIZE)`
You are not allowed to read more or less than `READ_SIZE` bytes at once from `fd`
You are free to pick the value that you want for `READ_SIZE`
- This macro defines the number of bytes you will read each time you will call `read`: `read(fd, buffer, READ_SIZE)`
- You are not allowed to read more or less than `READ_SIZE` bytes at once from `fd`
- You are free to pick the value that you want for `READ_SIZE`
- You can assume that `fd` will always be the same

- This macro defines the number of bytes you will read each time you will call `read`: `read(fd, buffer, READ_SIZE)`
- You are not allowed to read more or less than `READ_SIZE` bytes at once from `fd`
- You are free to pick the value that you want for `READ_SIZE`

### 2. _getline: multi-fd

Handle multiple file descriptors.<!--plain-NL-->

- when called with `-1` you should free everything and reset all your static variables
