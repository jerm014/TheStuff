# Project 3064: Hack Week in C++
----

# Project Context

By this point, you’ve been exposed to many different programming languages, including C and Python. This project will provide you with an opportunity to use C++, a higher-level programming language based on C. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the 80s in order to add object-oriented programming capabilities to the C programming language.

In this project, you will design and develop a C++ application. It isn’t a language you’ve been introduced to, yet, but you have all the skills required to start utilizing this new language. You are tasked with designing and implementing a custom application of your choice, but it must follow the following theme:

Waves

# Resources

* [C++ Tutorial / Documentation](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
# Tools

Ideas for tools you could use:

* Qt (a C++ framework for building graphical applications)
* Boost (a C++ header library)
* Open CV (an open-source C++ library that includes hundreds of computer vision algorithms)
* WebKit (an engine for displaying websites - used by Chrome, Safari, etc.)
* Don’t let this list be your limit - C++ has some amazing libraries out there to try out!
