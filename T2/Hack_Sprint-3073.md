# Project 3073: Hack Sprint
----

## Project Context

Using all of the skills you’ve developed over the course of the last two trimesters, you’re going to team up with a partner in creating your very own project from start to finish. You’ll develop a design, narrow down what should be in your MVP (minimum viable product), and work together as a team to bring your idea to life. You have a limited number of days to work on this project, so be sure to keep your scope reasonable for you and your team.

On the last day of your project, we will meet at 9 AM for attendance. Afterwards, you and your team will get a chance to make any last-minute tweaks on your application as well as to have time to create an (up-to) 5-minute lightning-talk presentation about your program. At 1 PM, we’ll take attendance again and presentations will begin.

## Challenge

There is one rule that must be followed…your application must follow the theme given to you by your instructor. You and your team are free to interpret that in any way you see fit (keep it Safe For Work, though)! It will be fun to see how different everyone’s applications are during the lightning talks at the end of this Hack Sprint!

### Project Ideas

* Single page website
  * Figure out where you’d like to host it, maybe AWS, or GCP?
  * What kind of data do you need to store and where will you store it / retrieve it for your app?

* A terminal application
  * It doesn’t need to have a GUI to be awesome! You could totally make a cool application that interacts with some cool API you found or some algorithm you’ve created all within the terminal itself.

* A small game
  * You all know Python -`PyGame`is pretty easy to pick up, if you’re interested in programming a game.
  * Unity is also fun.

## Teams

You will create teams of 2 for this project

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on:

* Having a link to a public GitHub repository.
* Having a link to your hosted site or instructions on how to download and use your project.
* Participation in the creation of your tool or game (everyone on the team must make commits to the GitHub repository).
