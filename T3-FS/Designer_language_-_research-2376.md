## Put yourself in a Designer’s shoes

### Learning objectives

Understand how designers work by:

* solving a UX problem;
* writing a UX case study that explains your discoveries.

Be creative. You will not be evaluated on the success or feasibility of the final solution, but on how you have solved the initial problem, by writing a design case study that communicates each step of the process and what you have learned/discovered.

* [Here is a template to help you with the structure](https://intranet.atlasschool.com/concepts/218)
* To achieve this, you will follow the tasks below. Along the way, you will gather pieces of content that should give you enough substance to write your story.
* Make sure to include any photo of your notes, sketches (paper or whiteboard) and paper prototypes! You are also encouraged to include the materials provided by the research team in your case study.
### One project, 3 parts

This project is split in 3 parts:

* **Research**(*current project*) : this one, where you will get familiar with these 3 personas, UX problems and starting to think about solutions
* **Prototype**: put in[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)your thinking prototypes
* **Validate**: share your work with other users/students and get feedback on it

The final result will be a blog post, posted in LinkedIn and/or Medium, that you will add more contents during each part.

## Tasks

**After reviewing the business’ goals at the end of last quarter, the Research team wants to identify if we have an opportunity to make users’ stream more content. They have identified a challenge which they think is worth exploring:“Improve how Spotify users find music to listen to.”**

With this in mind, the UX Research team gathered data and conducted user interviews. Here are a few personas that illustrate different chunks of the user base for this challenge:

* Alex, student, wants to find better focus while he studies.[Persona – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/536bc3f4fb09765e5ae9.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T180445Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=680902623cd99a0940254c4817452a1738452152ed8a530fa599cd2ffedcff5f)-[User Journey Map – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/f243fe643f8b845f3c2e.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T180446Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=544567a3b5b279ce5339ed9b27d75922e3d2221edc772b389ce40cde6e4673f4)

## Tasks

### 0. Empathize & define opportunities for improvement

With this first assignment, you are trying to understand who you are designing for and how you can make their experience more delightful or reduce the fiction. To achieve this, you need to set aside your assumptions. You are not the user, you cannot anticipate their behavior and needs.
And from this experience, you can define where/when this is room for improvement without being distracted by your gut feelings.<!--plain-NL-->

- Read the personas from above, choose one of them.
- Read their user journey map.
- Assuming you are this person, follow and reproduce each step of their journey.
- Make a list of all the opportunities for improving this experience.

**Things you should have collected:**<!--code-NL-->

- The persona and user journey map you have chosen
- A list of opportunities for improvements

**Post only blog post here for all tasks**<!--code-NL-->


---
### 1. Sketch: challenge assumptions and generate ideas

Based on what you have learned from the first task, you will now generate as many ideas as you can. Good or bad, you want them ALL.<!--plain-NL-->

You are now in a brainstorming mode: think outside the box. Have you thought about the worst possible idea? Sketch it as well.<!--plain-NL-->

Don’t aim for perfect sketches—aim for ideas in quantity. Draw by hand, on a whiteboard or on paper. Remember to take a photo of each idea.<!--plain-NL-->

**Things you should have collected:**<!--code-NL-->

- Photos of your sketched ideas


---
### 2. Decide: choose the idea to elaborate

Gather in groups based on the persona you have chosen. Everyone should present their ideas and the group should help you to choose the best idea to explore in the next phase.<!--plain-NL-->

- As the speaker, briefly pitch the opportunities you have found from the user’s journey and show your sketched ideas.
- As a reviewer, if you think your peer has made an assumption, question it.


Example: If you hear *“The user will right-click on the song and […]”*, ask *“Will the user know that they should right-click?”*:
- Example: If you hear *“The user will right-click on the song and […]”*, ask *“Will the user know that they should right-click?”*:

- Example: If you hear *“The user will right-click on the song and […]”*, ask *“Will the user know that they should right-click?”*:

**Things you should have collected:**<!--code-NL-->

- Photo of chosen solution
- Text explaining: “Why did you and your team choose to explore this idea over the other ones?”
- There are no bad ideas: list all initials ideas with pros/cons for each that make you or your team decide which way you want to take
