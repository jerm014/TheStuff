# Project 2391: Designer language - prototype
----


Based on the project[Designer language - research](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/621)-*reuse the same blog post*

## Resources

**Read or watch**:

* [Communicating your needs and giving constructive feedback](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/215)– my 2cents on making friends with designers :)
* [What is the role of a designer? What are their responsibilities?](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/216)
* [How does a designer typically work?](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/217)
* [Design Glossary from Usability.org](https://digital.gov/topics/usability/)– resources to be used at any time for short definition of design vocabulary.
* [UX Case Study Template](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/218)
## Put yourself in a Designer’s shoes

### Learning objectives

Understand how designers work by:

* solving a UX problem;
* writing a UX case study that explains your discoveries.

Be creative. You will not be evaluated on the success or feasibility of the final solution, but on how you have solved the initial problem, by writing a design case study that communicates each step of the process and what you have learned/discovered.

* [Here is a template to help you with the structure](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/218)
* To achieve this, you will follow the tasks below. Along the way, you will gather pieces of content that should give you enough substance to write your story.
* Make sure to include any photo of your notes, sketches (paper or whiteboard) and paper prototypes! You are also encouraged to include the materials provided by the research team in your case study.
### One project, 3 parts

This project is split in 3 parts:

* **Research**: where you will get familiar with these 3 personas, UX problems and starting to think about solutions
* **Prototype**(*current project*) : this one, put in[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)your thinking prototypes
* **Validate**: share your work with other users/students and get feedback on it

The final result will be a blog post, posted in LinkedIn and/or Medium, that you will add more contents during each part.

## Tasks

**After reviewing the business’ goals at the end of last quarter, the Research team wants to identify if we have an opportunity to make users’ stream more content. They have identified a challenge which they think is worth exploring:“Improve how Spotify users find music to listen to.”**

With this in mind, the UX Research team gathered data and conducted user interviews. Here are a few personas that illustrate different chunks of the user base for this challenge:

* Alex, student, wants to find better focus while he studies.[Persona – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/536bc3f4fb09765e5ae9.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T181452Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8ab2f02391fa1c06dc17709ab7f88ee70dad24aa3b0c454921055f88394c4931)-[User Journey Map – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/f243fe643f8b845f3c2e.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T181453Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=32ad502b56b64d949d487916b3aaee4552c10f2ed9e5a42ad546647cca156a29)

### 0. Prototype: make your solution real enough

In order to validate your solution, you need to produce a prototype that looks like the real product.<!--plain-NL-->

- First, you will need to first storyboard your solution.


Sketch the user flow on a whiteboard or on paper
Take a photo
- Sketch the user flow on a whiteboard or on paper
- Take a photo
- Then, design the high-fidelity mockups in Figma


If you are not familiar with Figma, take a quick tour of the interface.
- If you are not familiar with Figma, take a quick tour of the interface.
- And finally, pull them together to make your prototype interactive (clickable)


Learn about prototyping with Figma

- Sketch the user flow on a whiteboard or on paper

- If you are not familiar with Figma, take a quick tour of the interface.

**Things you should have collected:**<!--code-NL-->

- Storyboard of user flow (photo of whiteboard or sketches)
- The link to view your “pixel-perfect” mockups
- The link to access the interactive prototype on Figma

Please submit a link to a blog post (on Medium or by using a Google Doc, if you don’t want to make it public). In the blog post you should include the images of your mockups as well as your Figma design. Talk the audience through your design process and where you finally landed in your design!<!--plain-NL-->
