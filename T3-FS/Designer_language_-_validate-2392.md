## Put yourself in a Designer’s shoes

### Learning objectives

Understand how designers work by:

* solving a UX problem;
* writing a UX case study that explains your discoveries.

Be creative. You will not be evaluated on the success or feasibility of the final solution, but on how you have solved the initial problem, by writing a design case study that communicates each step of the process and what you have learned/discovered.

* [Here is a template to help you with the structure](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/218)
* To achieve this, you will follow the tasks below. Along the way, you will gather pieces of content that should give you enough substance to write your story.
* Make sure to include any photo of your notes, sketches (paper or whiteboard) and paper prototypes! You are also encouraged to include the materials provided by the research team in your case study.
### One project, 3 parts

This project is split in 3 parts:

* **Research**: where you will get familiar with these 3 personas, UX problems and starting to think about solutions
* **Prototype**: put in[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)your thinking prototypes
* **Validate**: this one, share your work with other users/students and get feedback on it

The final result will be a blog post, posted in LinkedIn and/or Medium, that you will add more contents during each part.

## Tasks

**After reviewing the business’ goals at the end of last quarter, the Research team wants to identify if we have an opportunity to make users’ stream more content. They have identified a challenge which they think is worth exploring:“Improve how Spotify users find music to listen to.”**

With this in mind, the UX Research team gathered data and conducted user interviews. Here are a few personas that illustrate different chunks of the user base for this challenge:

* Alex, student, wants to find better focus while he studies.[Persona – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/536bc3f4fb09765e5ae9.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T182912Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=848d478ffb5eaeeb091753bc7a996dcc9e246dc576b90110c7063d2b5bc729f6)-[User Journey Map – Alex.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/2/f243fe643f8b845f3c2e.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250303%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250303T182913Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=65f770593c6218c7e44e935d1218d18beea591f2a521497819e9732f58b56d25)

## Tasks

### 0. Validate: try your solution out

Validating your prototype means you will either discover if your solution works—or not. And that’s fine!<!--plain-NL-->

In both cases you have made progress by learning something. In a usual business set up, if the solutions don’t work you will go back to the first phase of the project in that case, and iterate.<!--plain-NL-->

**In order to test your solution, you will conduct a usability study.**<!--code-NL-->

In order to avoid influencing the participant during the test, here are permissible phrases you can say.<!--plain-NL-->

- Recruit 5 participants from other teams.
- Explain to them the task they have to perform.
- Observe them one by one to interact with your prototype.
- Take notes of what they say/do and how they react.
- Video recoding of the interview is a plus

Tip: you can film them with Photoboth on your computer while they interact + film the screen by holding it. Focus on asking questions if you notice they are stuck or hesitating. And then, allow some time to review the videos and take your notes.<!--plain-NL-->

**Things you should have collected:**<!--code-NL-->

- **A short paragraph** for each participant you have interviewed:


Did they successfully complete the task?
If not, what happened? How did they feel? What did they say/do?
- Did they successfully complete the task?
- If not, what happened? How did they feel? What did they say/do?
- **A conclusion** that describes what are the next steps for this solution:


Was it a total success? -&gt; recommend to send it for implementation
Was it a partial success? -&gt; what did you learn about this solution?
Was it a failure overall? -&gt; what is your recommendation then? Redefine the problem in phase no 2? Test other ideas from phase no 3?…
- Was it a total success? -&gt; recommend to send it for implementation
- Was it a partial success? -&gt; what did you learn about this solution?
- Was it a failure overall? -&gt; what is your recommendation then? Redefine the problem in phase no 2? Test other ideas from phase no 3?…
