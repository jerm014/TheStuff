# Project 3070: Custom Frontend From Scratch
----

# Project Info

Animation. From feature length to short films, East to West, and in-between, hand-drawn, claymation, computer generated— It’s all on the table.

You are tasked with making a 2+ page website around animation. You can interpret this theme in any way you can. You can focus on something listed above, or you can make a website for a fake animation studio! You can even make the website about another topic entirely while incorporating animations in your entire site!

*note, if you do that last option, inserting a bunch of gifs does not count, I mean using CSS, JS, or other frameworks to create animations on your pages*

Interpret the theme how you’d like! The goal is to make a site that is personal to you, something that reflects who you are as a person. A project you’re passionate about that can double as an excellent portfolio piece!

This is your opportunity to showcase everything you’ve learned this trimester!
